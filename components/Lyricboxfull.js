          Our story has been around for a long time <br />
          She’s gone away She’s gone away <br />
          I’ve known all of this time I should move on <br />
          Don't dwell on the past. <br />
          <br />
          Try to forget picture of you who love me <br />
          How can I forget you <br />
          Or is the heart still stubborn to keep you <br />
          What do i have to do <br />
          <br />
          I don’t know why I still can’t to forget you <br />
          Because last night I dreamt of you <br />
          I dreamt of you <br />
          I dreamt of you <br />
          It’s you <br />
          still you <br />
          <br />
          Or I keep it with pictures of the past that once loved each other I
          just want to delete to forget it all <br />
          I don't want to go back and miss her. repeat the pain in the heart
          <br />
          <br />
          I just want to forget you <br />
          What do i have to do <br />
          <br />
          I don’t know why I still can’t to forget you <br />
          Because last night I dreamt of you <br />
          I dreamt of you <br />
          I dreamt of you <br />
          It’s you <br />
          still you <br />
        </div>
      </div>
